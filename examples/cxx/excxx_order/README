This example shows how Oracle Berkeley Database can be used to implement 
a MacDonald Self-Service Ordering System.This application provides the 
communication interface via command line.

There are two main entrance points for the system: administrator and customer.
Administrator needs to set up environment and load the product data into
 database and then customer can order the products.The command line will 
 provide several command flags such as "o","c","D","d" and so on.

Administrator: manage the testing environment and manage the product 
information, incuding insert product into the product database by reading 
directly or by bulk operation. Login unsername for administrator is admin and
password for administrator is admin.

Customer: manage the order information and display the product information, 
including insert the product into order database,display order database and 
product database.

This example provides two ways for administrator or customer to access data 
which includes bulk operation and non bulk operation.

Before running the system, the input file is needed with the following format
in the ./project directory:

product.txt
1&Chicken Burger&20&Burger
2&Chicken Bacon Ranch&17&Salad
3&Chicken McNuggets&15&Chicken
4&Apple Slices&14&Snack

BUILD and RUN
